5852,Brazil,"Pear, apple and wet-stone aromas are tight, while this blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir feels citrusy, high in acidity and chalky. Green apple and orange flavors finish stony and crisp.",Brut,88,36.0,Pinto Bandeira,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Cave Geisse 2014 Brut Sparkling (Pinto Bandeira),Sparkling Blend,Cave Geisse
9151,Brazil,This opens with dusty dried-apple aromas. High acidity preserves its composure even though the fruit is marginal and vacillates between flavors of apple and lemony citrus.,Brut,83,31.0,Santa Catarina,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Villaggio Grando 2011 Brut Sparkling (Santa Catarina),Sparkling Blend,Villaggio Grando
10565,Brazil,"The name is appropriate: this is intense, just not in the best way. On the nose, this Tannat smells furry and earthy, with cherry notes. A wiry pulling palate is once again intenso, with black cherry, pepper and cocoa flavors that don't expand, contract or change on a monotone finish.",Intenso,84,,Campanha,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Salton 2013 Intenso Tannat (Campanha),Tannat,Salton
10579,Brazil,"Roasted gritty aromas of asphalt and grilled beef aren't friendly or fruity. In the mouth, this Cab Franc is full but lacks foundation and shape. Flavors of bacon, roasted berry fruits and rubber are a bit overripe on the finish.",Intenso,84,,Campanha,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Salton 2013 Intenso Cabernet Franc (Campanha),Cabernet Franc,Salton
12669,Brazil,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend almost has enough of the right stuff to rate higher, but in the end the wine's tart cherry fruit and sharp acidity is just too unfriendly. Like so many Brazilian wines, it's trying to be more than the country's terroir can give. So the end result is mediocre.",Reserva,83,20.0,Serra Gaúcha,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Château Lacave 2002 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Serra Gaúcha),Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Château Lacave
13218,Brazil,"This leesy, bready, heavily toasted Brazilian sparkler offers heady vanilla and caramel notes on the nose. A round, plump, soda-like palate is home to toasty, leesy, lightly oxidized apple flavors that finish briny, bready and marginally fresh. Drink now.",Brut 130,86,20.0,Vale dos Vinhedos,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Casa Valduga NV Brut 130  (Vale dos Vinhedos),Champagne Blend,Casa Valduga
14726,Brazil,"Bell pepper and sharp red fruit aromas provide a shaky start, which is followed by cranberry, tart cherry and other pointed flavors. The feel is racy and tight, with gritty acids. Airing does improve it somewhat. Tasted twice; this is a review of the better bottle. Cabernet, Merlot, Cab Franc and Carmenère is the blend. From Brazil.",Proprietary Red,82,10.0,Serra Gaúcha,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Aurora Cellars 2004 Proprietary Red Red (Serra Gaúcha),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Aurora Cellars
14734,Brazil,"A weird Cabernet with unfamiliar, odd aromas. Tight as nails and sheering, with sour plum and incongruent buttery oak flavors. Barrel influence shows up on the finish. Needs polish and improvement.",Gran Reserva,81,36.0,Vale dos Vinhedos,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Casa Valduga 2007 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Vale dos Vinhedos),Cabernet Sauvignon,Casa Valduga

15989,Brazil,"Aromas of lemon-lime and lemon-scented household cleaner precede an easy palate with soft bubbles. Lime and lychee flavors are textbook for Moscatel, while this feels pretty good and not cloying on the finish.",Cave Amadeu,86,25.0,Pinto Bandeira,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Cave Geisse NV Cave Amadeu Moscatel (Pinto Bandeira),Moscatel,Cave Geisse
20987,Brazil,"A dark salmon color and yeasty soapy aromas announce a bubbly that's not fully fresh or fruity. On the palate, this is low on acidity and short on bubbles. Yeasty melon and citrus flavors are short and soft on a low-acid finish.",Poética Rosé,85,,Brazil,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Salton NV Poética Rosé Sparkling (Brazil),Sparkling Blend,Salton
23883,Brazil,"This self-described “soft” Cabernet is light and low in alcohol. Aromas of herbal berry fruits precede a round plump palate with jammy plum and currant flavors. While quaffable and a touch sweet, this bears little resemblance to what most people expect from Cab Sauvignon.",Macaw,85,15.0,Serra Gaúcha,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Casa Perini 2014 Macaw Cabernet Sauvignon (Serra Gaúcha),Cabernet Sauvignon,Casa Perini
25068,Brazil,"Neutral aromas include hints of sea foam and salty brine. This Brazilian brut feels standard and regular. Peachy flavors are mild and a touch grassy, while this feels waxy on the finish.",Brut,85,23.0,Brazil,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Casa Valduga 2015 Brut  (Brazil),Champagne Blend,Casa Valduga
25081,Brazil,"A dark color and a soft nose with woodsy cherry scents form the greeting on this Brazilian Pinot Noir. Despite being dark and seemingly dense, this feels scalped and high in acidity. Dry but bland flavors of plum and black cherry are slightly bitter prior to a modest finish.",Paradoxo,85,,Campanha,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Salton 2014 Paradoxo Pinot Noir (Campanha),Pinot Noir,Salton
25509,Brazil,"Attractive aromas of gardenia, lemon-lime soda and lychee fruit set up a full foamy sugar-enriched palate with an acidic cut. Quick easy flavors of green melon and lychee are lasting on the finish. If you like sparking Moscato, this is your type of wine.",,88,20.0,Vale Trentino,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Casa Perini NV Moscatel (Vale Trentino),Moscatel,Casa Perini
26923,Brazil,"Applesauce and wheat aromas immediately make this wine slightly unappealing. In the mouth, it feels bubbly and fruity, with candied apple and orange flavors, followed by a finish that's a mix of sweet corn and dry citrus.",Gerações Espumante Nature,82,26.0,Brazil,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Salton NV Gerações Espumante Nature Sparkling (Brazil),Sparkling Blend,Salton
26928,Brazil,"This wine's cola, forest floor, cherry and cassis aromas are promising, but on the palate it's a tannic crusher, with mouth-blasting acids. It feels abrasive and tastes of rubbery black fruits.",Agnus Encruzilhada do Sul,82,15.0,Serra do Sudeste,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Lidio Carraro 2010 Agnus Encruzilhada do Sul Merlot (Serra do Sudeste),Merlot,Lidio Carraro
26933,Brazil,"This is jumpy and aggressive on the nose, with lemon-lime aromas akin to Sprite. Grabby almost to the point of being cloying, it is driven by classic Moscato flavors of lime and sweet lychee. It's chalky without a good follow through.",Carnaval,82,15.0,Brazil,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Vinícola Aurora NV Carnaval Moscato (Brazil),Moscato,Vinícola Aurora
27108,Brazil,"Rusty in color and murky on the palate, this earthy, mature wine smells a bit too much like a mud puddle, with herbal, green notes mixed in. Tannic, drying and austere, this Cabernet tastes leafy, with a salty, earthy, stewy finish.",Gran Reserva Villa-Lobos,83,27.0,Vale dos Vinhedos,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Casa Valduga 2006 Gran Reserva Villa-Lobos Cabernet Sauvignon (Vale dos Vinhedos),Cabernet Sauvignon,Casa Valduga
27112,Brazil,"Stalky, herbal, earthy aromas are flat, while the palate on this rusty-looking Tannat feels citric and raw. Earthy, leafy flavors are sharp but also low on fruit and depth, and the wine finishes similarly.",Aurora Cellars Reserva,82,15.0,Serra Gaúcha,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Vinícola Aurora 2011 Aurora Cellars Reserva Tannat (Serra Gaúcha),Tannat,Vinícola Aurora
28028,Brazil,"Hot saucy plum and berry aromas set up an abrasive tannic palate that's choppy and short.

34202,Brazil,"Honest black-fruit, oak, graphite and spice aromas give this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon a solid bouquet. In the mouth, this is grabby and tannic, with black cherry, leather and prune flavors. A chewy, tannic finish deals resiny oak, raisiny notes and loamy length.

36386,Brazil,"Initial aromas of vanilla wafer give way to pear scents and minerality. This wine has creamy weight but acidic cut and pulse along with melon, vanilla and lightly oaked flavors. Honey, vanilla and a touch of pithy bitterness compete with melony notes on the finish.",Dádivas,88,20.0,Serra Gaúcha,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Lidio Carraro 2013 Dádivas Chardonnay (Serra Gaúcha),Chardonnay,Lidio Carraro
43246,Brazil,"Peach pit and citrus-rind aromas are solid, focused and dry. This brut rosé feels sound and round, but foamy.

51466,Brazil,"Stale fruit and damp-earth aromas are a warning sign. In the mouth, this Cabernet Sauvignon is raw and acidic, with hard tannins.

54026,Brazil,"A stewy nose includes notes of mashed leaves, herbal berry fruits, prune and black tea. The palate on this Merlot-Cab Sauvignon blend is heavily extracted and jammy, with hard-pounding tannins.

94573,Brazil,"Prune and metallic aromas are not fully integrated and fresh but improve with airing.

101575,Brazil,"A sniff of this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tannat and Ancellotta is like a walk through the sawmill.
